    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to develop a rigorous understanding of differentiable explanations from three angles\n",
    "\n",
    "- Theory: what questions explanations answer and what assumptions they rely on  \n",
    "- Mathematics: the precise objects being computed and their structural properties  \n",
    "- Practice: how these objects behave when computed in real neural networks  \n",
